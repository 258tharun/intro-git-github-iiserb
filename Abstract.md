# Abstract
Working on coding projects can be a tedious task where you build upon several weeks' work. When more than one person is involved in the project, it gets even more complicated to keep track of all the changes and prevent synchronous changes from conflicting. A Version Control System (VCS) comes to your rescue in such a situation. A VCS keeps track of all the changes to the source code, lets you switch back to an earlier version of the work, and efficiently resolves the conflicts in contemporary works. One of the most popular and widely used VCS is Git. Git has proved to be an essential tool for any programming project, second only to the programming language itself.

In this introductory talk, we will learn the basic concepts and terminology of version control. Then we will focus on Git while trying to explore its fundamental commands and their function and dip our toes into some advanced commands that are frequently useful. After some familiarity with Git, we will learn to host our software projects remotely on GitHub to access them from any machine and collaborate with others. Towards the end, we will also demonstrate how to use all the things we learnt during the talk to make open-source contributions on GitHub.
