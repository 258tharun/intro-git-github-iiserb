# Abstract
Working on coding projects can be a tedious task where you build upon the work you do continuously for several days. When more than one person is involved in the project, it gets even more complicated to keep track of all the changes and prevent concurrent works from conflicting. This is where a Version Control System (VCS) comes to your rescue. A VCS keeps track of all the changes to the source code, lets you switch back to an earlier version of the work, and efficiently resolves the conflicts in contemporary works. One of the most popular and widely used VCS is Git.

In this talk, we will first describe the basic concepts of Version control like working tree, staging area, and local and remote repositories. Then we will focus on Git and move ahead by introducing you to the basic commands required in almost all projects, like status, add, remove and commit. After this, we will cover some advanced topics and commands like branches, merging, rebase etc. and move beyond working on files locally to hosting git repositories remotely on GitHub and managing your remote repository with fetch, pull and push. Towards the end, we will also demonstrate how to make an open-source contribution on GitHub.
